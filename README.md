# CO2 Emissions Worldwide
Our visualization displays levels of CO2 intensity (CO2 emissions per economic output) by country by year from 1960 to 2010.

# Running Instructions
Download the files to a folder and run index.html (though not through Chrome since it won't load in the data).

# Story Board
See the [storyboard](storyboard.pdf). This also includes our final writeup. One thing we were unable to fix is that the data does not display on being loaded; one has to move the slider first for data to display.

# Development Process
A lot of our time was spent on figuring out very basic HTML/Javascript/D3 actions. It's hard to describe who did what because most things were a combination of many little contributions from different people.
* Initial planning/storyboarding - Alec and Hoiyi
* Getting initial map displayed - Hoiyi and Alec
* Loading in the data - Hoiyi and Alec
* Creating hover icons - Hoiyi
* Legend - Hoiyi
* Modifying hover icon text - Alec
* Time slider - Ning
* Linking up slider to data - Ning and Alec
* Speeding up data access to update immediately - Alec
* Organization/setting up github/coordinating code - Alec
* Writeup - Alec

For Alec, the time division would probably be about 6 hours - writing stuff/setting up Github/coordinating over email with people, probably about 20-25 hours dealing with code, most of which was searching for stuff online, looking for examples, reading pieces of tutorials.
