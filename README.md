# Projecting Carbon Emissions

# Abstract (from paper):

The goal of our visualization is to display how carbon emissions of different countries change over time. Our primary users are scientists and researchers who want to use the data to quickly gain a sense of overall carbon trends and patterns over the past 50 years worldwide, and how they relate to population size and economic output. By allowing users to interact with animated world maps and line charts, our visualization encourages researchers to develop scientific questions and specific analyses. In this paper, we will discuss related work that inspired our choice of visualization and details of our work.

# Running Instructions
Download the files to a folder and run index.html which will bring up the map (though not through Chrome since it won't load in the data). The drop-down menu at the right can be used to switch between the two maps and the line chart. The line chart can be opened directly by running index_lines.html.

# Development Process
Our visualization is a combined effort of Alec and Hoiyi with Alec focusing on creating line charts and Hoiyi extending the maps from our A3 submission. The work distribution can be briefly broken down as follows:

Maps: Primarily Hoiyi
* World maps - Hoiyi
* Getting initial map displayed - Hoiyi and Alec
* Loading in the data - Hoiyi and Alec
* Creating hover icons - Hoiyi
* Legend - Hoiyi
* Modifying hover icon text - Alec
* Slider - Hoiyi
* Map animation - Hoiyi
* Zooming - Hoiyi
* Speeding up data access to update immediately - Alec
* Hover style - Hoiyi
* Dropdown menu - Hoiyi

Line charts: Alec
* Line charts and interactivity - Alec

Other:
* Organization/setting up github/formatting submission - Alec
* Project proposal - Alec
* Progress presentation - mostly Alec
* Poster - mostly Hoiyi
