# CO2 Emissions Worldwide
Our visualization displays levels of CO2 intensity (CO2 emissions per economic output) across countries from 1960 to 2010.

# Running Instructions
Download the files to a folder and run index.html (though not through Chrome since it won't load in the data).

# Story Board
See the [storyboard](storyboard.pdf). This also includes our final writeup. One thing we were unable to fix is that the data does not display on being loaded; one has to move the slider first for data to display.

# Development Process
Our visualization is a combined effort of Alec and Hoiyi with Alec focusing on creating line charts and Hoiyi focusing on improving users' experience with the maps. The work distribution can be briefly broken down as follows:

* World maps - Hoiyi
* Getting initial map displayed - Hoiyi and Alec
* Loading in the data - Hoiyi and Alec
* Creating hover icons - Hoiyi
* Legend - Hoiyi
* Modifying hover icon text - Alec
* Slider - Hoiyi
* Map animation - Hoiyi
* Zooming - Hoiyi
* Hover style - Hoiyi
* Dropdown menu - Hoiyi
* Line charts - Alec
* Speeding up data access to update immediately - Alec
* Organization/setting up github/coordinating code - Alec
